# Privacy Policy
We are committed to safeguarding your privacy. When you use our browser extension, we collect minimal information necessary to provide our service. Specifically, we access the URL of the currently active tab to perform DNS queries and display DNS record data. This information is used solely for the purpose of providing you with accurate DNS records and is not stored or retained after the session ends. If you manually enter a domain name and select a DNS record type, this data is used temporarily to conduct the requested queries and is not stored.  We do not share or disclose any of your personal information to third parties. The extension uses a remote DNS resolver (Google DNS API) to fetch DNS records, but this data is sent directly to the API and is not processed or stored by us. We employ industry-standard security measures to protect your data, although no method of transmission over the internet is completely secure.  We do not retain any personal data, and data collected is processed in real-time and discarded after use. You have the right to review and update the information you provide, but since no data is stored, there is no data to delete.
